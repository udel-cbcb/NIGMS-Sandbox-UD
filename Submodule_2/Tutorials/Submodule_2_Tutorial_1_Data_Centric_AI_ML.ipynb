    "# Data-Centric AI/ML: Diabetes Dataset Example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore the concept of **Data-Centric AI/ML**, where the focus is on improving the quality of the dataset to enhance model performance. Using the **Diabetes Dataset**, we demonstrate how data cleaning, feature engineering, and iterative data improvement can lead to better model accuracy. This approach emphasizes the importance of high-quality data over complex model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "* Understand the principles of **Data-Centric AI/ML**.\n",
    "* Learn how to clean and preprocess a biomedical dataset effectively.\n",
    "* Perform **feature engineering** to create meaningful features.\n",
    "* Identify and correct **noisy labels** in the dataset.\n",
    "* Evaluate the impact of data-centric improvements on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "* Basic knowledge of Python and Pandas.\n",
    "* Familiarity with machine learning concepts (e.g., classification, Random Forests).\n",
    "* Libraries installed: pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Started\n",
    "Letâ€™s begin by loading the dataset and performing a data-centric workflow. The workflow includes:\n",
    "* **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.\n",
    "* **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like BMI categories.\n",
    "* **Model Training**: Training a baseline Random Forest model.\n",

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how a data-centric approach can improve model performance by focusing on:\n",
    "* **Iterative Data Improvement**: The code now actively detects and corrects noisy labels, retraining the model to show improved performance.\n",
    "* **Label Consistency and Noise Reduction**: Synthetic noise is introduced and then mitigated, mimicking real-world data imperfections.\n",
    "* **Data Quality Over Model Complexity**: The focus remains on fixing the data, not tweaking the model.\n",
    "* **Domain Knowledge Integration**: The rule uses Glucose (a key diabetes indicator) and model predictions, reflecting biomedical intuition.\n",
    "* **Quantifying Improvements**: The accuracy increases and plot clearly shows the impact of data-centric changes.\n",
