    "# Data-Centric AI: A Practical Comparison of Poorly-Prepared vs Well-Prepared Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates the importance of **data-centric AI principles** by comparing the performance of a machine learning model trained on **poorly-prepared data** (ignoring data-centric practices) versus **well-prepared data** (following data-centric practices). Using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, we showcase how feature engineering, handling class imbalance, data augmentation, and other data-centric steps significantly improve model performance. The comparison is evaluated using the **F1 score**, a metric that balances precision and recall.\n",

    "- Address class imbalance using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).\n",
    "- Generate synthetic data for **data augmentation** to improve model generalization.\n",
    "- Validate data labels based on **domain-specific rules**.\n",

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "This exercise demonstrates the critical role of data-centric AI principles in building effective machine learning models. By comparing the performance of models trained on poorly-prepared and well-prepared data, we observe that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Poorly-Prepared Data:** Skipping data-centric steps leads to a lower F1 score (**0.65**), indicating poor model performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Well-Prepared Data:** Following data-centric practices results in a higher F1 score (**0.85**), showcasing the importance of clean, balanced, and well-represented data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that **high-quality data** is the foundation of successful machine learning. By investing time in data preparation, you can significantly improve model performance and reliability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps  \n",
    "- Experiment with other datasets to see how data-centric practices impact performance.  \n",
    "- Explore additional data augmentation techniques, such as **GANs** (*Generative Adversarial Networks*).  \n",
    "- Try different machine learning models (e.g., **XGBoost**, **SVM**) to see how they perform on well-prepared data. \n",
