    "This module focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of diabetes risk factors using physiological measurements. We will work with the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to investigate patterns, trends, and relationships between various health metrics—such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI—and diabetes outcomes. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover insights that can help identify key risk factors and inform strategies for diabetes prevention and management. This hands-on exploration will provide a deeper understanding of how data-driven approaches can be used to address public health challenges.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Perform EDA on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to identify diabetes risk factors.\n",
    "- Conduct statistical analysis:\n",
    "    - Descriptive statistics to compare health metrics (e.g., glucose, BMI).\n",
    "    - Inferential statistics (ANOVA) to test differences in glucose levels across age groups.\n",
    "- Create visualizations:\n",
    "    - Univariate histograms with KDE for health metric distributions.\n",
    "    - Multivariate correlation heatmaps and pairplots to explore relationships.\n",
    "- Analyze patterns in diabetic attributes (e.g., glucose, BMI, age as key risk factors).\n",
