## **Overview**
The module prioritizes practical, data-centric techniques, ensuring researchers can immediately apply their acquired data science and AI/ML knowledge to real-world problems. We aim to train the participants with the competencies and skills needed to make biomedical data FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) and AI/ML-ready. The module also utilizes a blend of engaging instructional videos, interactive demonstrations, hands-on exercises to facilitate self-directed learning and knowledge retention. 

## **Background**
The landscape of biomedical research is experiencing a fundamental shift, transitioning from hypothesis-driven approaches to data-driven discoveries fueled by the large and complex datasets generated through high-throughput technologies. Effectively analyzing and extracting meaningful insights from these datasets requires researchers to be proficient in advanced computational methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Furthermore, cloud computing offers flexible, cost-effective, and powerful solutions for data storage, analysis, and collaboration without the infrastructure burden of individual institutions. However, unlocking the full potential of cloud-based AI/ML in biomedical research hinges on equipping researchers with the necessary skills and knowledge. Recognizing this gap, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) launched the NIGMS Sandbox initiative, aiming to create a repository of cloud-based learning modules for diverse biomedical data science topics. This module, "Practical Data-Centric AI/ML for Biomedical Researchers" aligns perfectly with the NIGMSâ€™s vision to expand the skilled workforce capable of harnessing the power of cloud computing and AI/ML. The module tackles the crucial challenge of upskilling biomedical researchers by equipping researchers with these skills to foster innovation, accelerate scientific discovery. By leveraging the NIGMS Sandbox and cloud platform, the module ensures broad accessibility. This democratizes access to cutting-edge knowledge, empowering researchers regardless of their institutional resources and fostering a more inclusive research landscape.
