In this lecture we will examine the data science lifecycle and generalize it to a concept that can easily be applied to any scientific data analysis."

As data has become more and more prevalent and our ability to analyze and reanalyze data has increased, there has been a growing need for standards to make sure that data produced today will still be accessible and usable tomorrow.  The FAIR data principles are a set of guidelines for how to achieve this.  Funding agencies including the NIH and NSF are increasingly asking (or requiring) their funded research to comply to these standards."
