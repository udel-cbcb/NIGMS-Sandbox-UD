    "Although numeric data can be directly used as input for Machine Learning models, it is often necessary to engineer features that are relevant to the specific scenario, problem, and domain before building a model. This underscores the importance of feature engineering. Key considerations for numeric features include their **scale** and **distribution**. In some cases, transformations are required to adjust the scale of numeric values, while in others, the overall distribution may need to be modified—for example, converting a skewed distribution into a normal distribution."

As a result, each value of the categorical variable is converted into a vector of size **m-1**. The remaining feature is entirely omitted, and if the category values range from {**0, 1, ..., m-1**}, the 0th or (m-1)th feature is typically represented by a vector of all zeros (**0**)."
