    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling or data munging is the process of cleaning, transforming, and mapping data from one form to another to utilize it for tasks such as analytics, summarization, reporting, visualization, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling is one of most important and involving steps in the whole Data Science workflow. The output of this process directly impacts all downstream steps such as exploration, summarization, visualization, analysis and even the final result. This clearly shows why Data Scientists spend a lot of time in Data Collection and Wrangling.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Alcohol**: alcohol content, reported in units of ABV (alcohol by volume).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Malic acid**: one of the principal organic acids found in wine. Although found in nearly every fruit and berry, itâ€™s flavor is most prominent in green apples; likewise, it projects this sour flavor into wine. For more information, feel free to read about acids in wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ash**: yep, wine has ash in it. Ash is simply the inorganic matter left after evaporation and incineration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Alcalinity of ash**: the alkalinity of ash determines how basic (as opposed to acidic) the ash in a wine is.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Magnesium**: magnesium is a metal that affects the flavor of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Total phenols**: Phenols are chemicals that affect the taste, color, and mouthfeel (i.e., texture) of wine. For some (very) in-depth information about phenols, we refer you to phenolic content in wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flavoids**: flavonoids are a type of phenol.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nonflavoid phenols**: nonflavonoids are another type of phenol.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proanthocyanins**: proanthocyanidins are yet another type of phenol.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Color intensity**: the color intensity of a wine: i.e., how dark it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hue**: the hue of a wine, which is typically determined by the color of the cultivar used (although this is not always the case).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OD280/OD315 of diluted wines**: protein content measurements.\n",

    "## Normalizing Numeric Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing values is a crucial step in machine learning to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process. Features with larger magnitude values can dominate the model, leading to bias and poor performance, especially in algorithms sensitive to scale, such as gradient-based methods (e.g., linear regression, neural networks) and distance-based algorithms (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, k-Means). Normalization scales features to a standard range, such as [0, 1] or a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps improve convergence speed, enhances model accuracy, and ensures fair comparison across features. Additionally, normalization reduces the impact of outliers, making the model more robust and reliable. By standardizing the data, normalization enables algorithms to perform optimally, leading to better generalization and interpretability of results.\n",
