    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination, or RFE for short, is a popular feature selection algorithm. RFE\n",
    "is popular because it is easy to configure and use, and effective at selecting those\n",
    "features (columns) in a training dataset that are more or most relevant in predicting the target\n",
    "variable. There are two important configuration options when using RFE: the choice in the\n",
    "number of features to select and the choice of the algorithm used to help choosing the features. Both\n",
    "of these hyperparameters can be explored, although the performance of the method is not\n",
    "strongly dependent on these hyperparameters being configured well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how RFE is an efficient approach for eliminating features from a training dataset for feature selection\n",
    "- Learn how to use RFE for feature selection for classification and regression predictive modeling problems\n",
    "- Learn how to explore the number of selected features and wrapped algorithm used by the RFE procedure\n",
    "- Understand how to evaluate different algorithms wrapped by RFE for optimal feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks to complete\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement RFE for classification problems\n",
    "- Implement RFE for regression problems \n",
    "- Explore RFE hyperparameters\n",
    "- Evaluate different estimator algorithms for RFE\n",
    "- Analyze selected features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- A working Python environment and familiarity with Python\n",
    "- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts\n",
    "- Familiarity with pandas and numpy libraries\n",
    "- Knowledge of basic statistical concepts"

    "Through this tutorial, we learned how to effectively use Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection in both classification and regression problems. We explored key hyperparameters like the number of features to select and the choice of wrapped algorithm. The techniques covered demonstrate how RFE can be used to identify the most relevant features for predictive modeling tasks.\n",
