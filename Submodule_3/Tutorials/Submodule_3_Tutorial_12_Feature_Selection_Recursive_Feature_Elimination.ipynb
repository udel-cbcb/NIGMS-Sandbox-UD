    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** is a widely-used feature selection algorithm. It is popular due to its simplicity, ease of configuration, and effectiveness in identifying the most relevant features (columns) in a training dataset for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using RFE, there are two important hyperparameters to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Features to Select**: This determines how many features the algorithm will retain.\n",
    "2. **Algorithm for Feature Selection**: The choice of algorithm (e.g., linear models, decision trees) used to evaluate feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these hyperparameters can be tuned, the performance of RFE is generally robust and not highly sensitive to their configuration. This makes RFE a versatile and reliable tool for feature selection in machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",

    "We begin by generating a synthetic binary classification dataset using scikit-learn's **make_classification()** function. This simulated dataset contains 1,000 samples with 10 input features, carefully structured to include five informative predictors that directly influence the target variable and five redundant features that are linear combinations of the informative ones. This controlled configuration allows us to evaluate feature selection methods while knowing ground truth feature importance, with the redundant features serving as an internal control to test a method's ability to filter out uninformative variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then implement Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a DecisionTreeClassifier as the estimator, configured to select the top five most predictive features. Following feature selection, we train a new **DecisionTreeClassifier** exclusively on these optimized features and evaluate performance using rigorous repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation (10 folds with 3 repeats). This evaluation protocol yields robust performance estimates, which we summarize through both the mean classification accuracy and standard deviation across all repetitions, providing insights into both model accuracy and stability. The entire pipeline - from feature selection to final evaluation - is designed to assess whether feature optimization can enhance model performance while maintaining interpretability through a reduced feature set."

While our previous analysis arbitrarily chose five features—aligning with the known structure of the synthetic dataset—real-world applications demand systematic evaluation. Since the optimal feature count is rarely known a priori, best practices recommend testing a range of values through cross-validation. This empirical approach not only identifies the most predictive subset but also helps balance the trade-off between model complexity (fewer features) and predictive power (more features).

This method extends the standard RFE approach by dynamically identifying the number of features that yield the highest mean performance score across validation folds. By iteratively removing the least important features and assessing model accuracy at each step, RFECV eliminates the need for manual threshold-setting while ensuring robust feature selection. As demonstrated in our prior analysis, this data-driven approach balances model complexity and predictive power by selecting only the most contributive features, mitigating overfitting risks inherent in high-dimensional datasets."

    "The RFE algorithm's flexibility allows integration with any predictive model that generates feature importance scores, though the specific selection results may vary across algorithms. While most decision-tree-based methods (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees) typically yield similar feature importance trends, subtle differences can emerge due to their distinct splitting criteria and regularization approaches. To ensure robust feature selection, practitioners should empirically evaluate multiple algorithms through systematic comparison - for instance, testing both linear models (like Logistic Regression with coefficient magnitudes) and non-linear tree-based approaches within the RFE framework. The following example illustrates this exploratory process by wrapping different estimators in RFE and comparing their selected feature subsets, which may reveal algorithm-dependent biases or reinforce consensus features."

    "This box plot compares the accuracy of different machine learning models, with the x-axis representing the names of the models and the y-axis showing their corresponding mean accuracy scores. The models being compared include Logistic Regression (lr), Perceptron (per), Decision Tree Classifier (dtc), Random Forest (rf), and Gradient Boosting Machine (gbm). Each box plot captures the distribution of mean accuracy values across multiple runs of the models, providing insights into their performance stability and effectiveness.\n",

    "The central orange line inside each box represents the median accuracy, while the green triangle indicates the mean accuracy. The boxes themselves depict the interquartile range (IQR), which encompasses the middle 50% of the accuracy values. The whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within a certain range, excluding any outliers, which appear as small circles beyond the whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Machine demonstrate the highest median and mean accuracy among all the models, suggesting they consistently perform well. In contrast, the Perceptron model has the lowest median accuracy and exhibits a noticeable outlier, indicating that its performance is less stable compared to the others. The Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest models show similar median accuracies, but Random Forest appears to be slightly more consistent with a more compact distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important observation is the variability in model performance. Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting have higher upper whiskers, indicating that these models have the potential to achieve strong accuracy scores in some cases. The Perceptron model, on the other hand, has a wider spread and a lower outlier, reinforcing its inconsistency. Random Forest appears to have a relatively stable performance with fewer extreme values, making it a reliable option.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting seem to be the most effective models in terms of both median and mean accuracy. Perceptron performs the weakest, showing lower accuracy and higher variation across runs. If stability and high performance are the main objectives, Gradient Boosting or Random Forest would likely be the best choices."

    "Through this tutorial, we learned how to effectively use Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection in both classification and regression problems. We explored key hyperparameters like the number of features to select and the choice of wrapped algorithm. The techniques covered demonstrate how RFE can be used to identify the most relevant features for predictive modeling tasks.\n",
