    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to\n",
    "a standard range. This includes algorithms that use a weighted sum of the input, like linear\n",
    "regression, and algorithms that use distance measures, like k-nearest neighbors. Standardizing\n",
    "is a popular scaling technique that subtracts the mean from values and divides by the standard\n",
    "deviation, transforming the probability distribution for an input variable to a standard Gaussian\n",
    "(zero mean and unit variance). Standardization can become skewed or biased if the input\n",
    "variable contains outlier values.\n",
    "To overcome this, the median and interquartile range can be used when standardizing\n",
    "numerical input variables, generally referred to as robust scaling.\n",

    "Robust scaling provides an effective way to standardize numerical variables when outliers are present. Different scaling ranges (like 10-90 or 15-85 percentiles) can outperform the default 25-75 percentile range, showing the importance of testing different scaling parameters.\n",
