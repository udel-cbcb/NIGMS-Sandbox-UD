    "# Feature Selection:  Select Numerical Input Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted from Jason Brownlee. 2020. [Data Preparation for Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-preparation-for-machine-learning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of input features that are most relevant to the target variable. While feature selection is often straightforward for **real-valued input and output data** (e.g., using Pearson's correlation coefficient), it can be more challenging when dealing with **numerical input data and a categorical target variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification tasks where the input features are numerical and the target variable is categorical, the two most commonly used feature selection methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ANOVA F-test Statistic**:\n",
    "   - Measures the variance between groups relative to the variance within groups.\n",
    "   - Suitable for identifying features that have a significant relationship with the categorical target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mutual Information Statistic**:\n",
    "   - Quantifies the amount of information obtained about the target variable through each feature.\n",
    "   - Effective for capturing non-linear relationships between features and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods help identify the most relevant features, improving model performance and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Numerical Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with numerical input features and a categorical target variable, two widely adopted feature selection techniques are particularly effective: the ANOVA F-statistic and mutual information statistics. The ANOVA F-test evaluates the linear relationship between each feature and the target by measuring variance between groups relative to variance within groups, making it ideal for identifying features with strong class separation. Mutual information, on the other hand, quantifies the dependency between variables without assuming linearity, capturing both linear and non-linear associations. While ANOVA is computationally efficient and interpretable, mutual information is more flexible for complex patterns. Together, these methods provide complementary perspectives—ANOVA for parametric, linear scenarios and mutual information for broader, non-parametric use cases—enabling robust feature selection when applied in tandem."

Notably, Features 1, 5, and 7 emerge as particularly influential, suggesting they may capture meaningful patterns in the target variable. This divergence in importance scores implies that these three features likely contribute disproportionately to model performance, while others may contain redundant or noisy information. However, domain-specific validation is recommended to confirm their practical significance, as high statistical scores alone don't guarantee causal relationships or operational relevance for the specific use case."

    "### Mutual Information Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutual information** is a concept from **information theory** that is widely applied in feature selection. It is based on the idea of **information gain**, which is commonly used in the construction of decision trees. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Mutual information measures the reduction in uncertainty for one variable when the value of another variable is known.\n",
    "- **Calculation**: It quantifies the dependency between two variables, making it a powerful tool for identifying relevant features in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application in Feature Selection\n",
    "- **Discrete Variables**: Mutual information is straightforward to calculate for two discrete variables (e.g., categorical or ordinal data).\n",
    "- **Numerical Input and Categorical Output**: It can also be adapted for use with numerical input features and a categorical target variable, making it versatile for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating mutual information between each input feature and the target variable, we can determine which features provide the most information for predicting the target, enabling effective feature selection."

    "The feature importance analysis reveals several variables with modestly low predictive scores, indicating they may contribute minimal value to the model. Notably, Features 1 and 5 emerge as the most statistically significant, suggesting they capture the strongest relationships with the target variable. While removing low-scoring features could streamline the model—potentially improving computational efficiency and reducing overfitting—their elimination should be validated through ablation testing. For instance, comparing model performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) before and after excluding these features would ensure robustness. If the impact is negligible, pruning them could yield a more parsimonious and interpretable model without sacrificing predictive power."

    "## Modeling With Selected Features\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure optimal model performance, a systematic evaluation of feature selection strategies is recommended. This involves testing multiple approaches (e.g., filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods) across varying numbers of selected features, then selecting the combination that yields the highest predictive accuracy on validation data. By comparing performance metrics across these configurations—rather than relying on a single feature selection technique—we mitigate the risk of method-specific biases and increase the likelihood of identifying the most robust subset of features. This comprehensive approach is particularly valuable when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where the relationship between features and target variables may be complex or non-linear."

    "To identify the most informative features for our predictive model, we can leverage the ANOVA F-test, a statistical method that evaluates the strength of linear relationships between numerical input features and a categorical target variable. By computing F-scores for each feature—which measure the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance—we rank all features by their predictive importance. Selecting the top four highest-scoring features provides an optimal balance between model simplicity and explanatory power, effectively reducing dimensionality while retaining the most statistically significant predictors. This approach is particularly advantageous when working with limited samples or when computational efficiency is prioritized, as it discards redundant or noisy variables that contribute little to classification accuracy. For implementation, scikit-learn’s SelectKBest with f_classif automates this process, enabling seamless integration into machine learning pipelines."

This intriguing result suggests that while alternative feature subsets may capture different aspects of the data, they ultimately provide comparable predictive power for this specific task. The finding highlights that raw feature count alone doesn’t determine model efficacy—what matters more is whether the selected features collectively encode sufficient discriminative information. Potential explanations include: (1) redundancy in the feature space where different subsets convey similar signals, (2) the existence of multiple near-optimal feature combinations, or (3) the model architecture’s capacity limitations. Further analysis could examine whether the new feature set offers advantages in interpretability, computational efficiency, or robustness to data shifts."

    "- Feature 1 shows the widest spread, indicating more variability in accuracy when using this feature.\n",
    "- Features 5, 6, 7, and 8 have slightly higher mean accuracy compared to others.\n",
    "- Features 3, 4, and 5 have some outliers on the lower end, suggesting occasional poor performance.\n",
    "- Median accuracy values are fairly consistent across most features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Insights**\n",
    "- If this represents feature selection, you might favor features 6, 7, and 8, as they appear stable with higher mean accuracy.\n",
    "- Features with high variance (e.g., Feature 1) could be investigated further—perhaps their usefulness depends on data splits.\n",
    "- If the goal is stability, avoiding features with large outliers (e.g., Feature 3 or 5) might be beneficial."

    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, we learned how to perform feature selection on numerical data for classification tasks. We explored two key methods - ANOVA F-test and mutual information statistics - and learned how to evaluate their effectiveness through model performance. We also discovered how to systematically tune feature selection parameters using grid search to find the optimal number of features.\n",

    "## Clean up\n",
