    "## Polynomial Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial features are generated by raising existing features to a specified exponent. For instance, if a dataset contains a single input feature \\( X \\), a polynomial feature can be created by squaring its values, resulting in a new feature \\( X^2 \\). This process can be applied to all input variables in the dataset, transforming each into higher-order terms. Polynomial features are a form of **feature engineering**, where new input features are derived from existing ones. The **degree** of the polynomial determines the number of new features added; for example, a degree of 3 would introduce two additional variables for each input feature. Typically, small degrees like 2 or 3 are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, **interaction terms** can be created by multiplying pairs of input variables, generating new features that capture relationships between them. For instance, a new column might represent the product of two variables. Both polynomial and interaction terms can alter the probability distribution of the data, amplifying the separation between small and large values as the exponent increases. This separation can enhance the performance of certain machine learning algorithms, particularly in **regression tasks** or other problems involving numerical input variables. Linear algorithms, such as **linear regression** and **logistic regression**, often benefit significantly from the inclusion of polynomial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polynomial Feature Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The polynomial feature transform is implemented in the **scikit-learn** Python library through the `PolynomialFeatures` class. This tool creates a new feature matrix containing all polynomial combinations of the input features up to the specified degree. For example, given a two-dimensional input sample \\([a, b]\\), the degree-2 polynomial features would include \\([1, a, b, a^2, ab, b^2]\\). This transformation helps capture nonlinear relationships in the data, improving model performance in many cases."

    "#### Plot Overview\n",
    "The plot visualizes how the number of features in a dataset changes as the degree of polynomial expansion increases. It demonstrates that the number of features grows exponentially with higher polynomial degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Observations:\n",
    "- **X-axis (Degree of Polynomial Features)**: Represents the degree used for polynomial feature generation.\n",
    "- **Y-axis (Number of Features)**: Represents the total number of features after applying polynomial expansion.\n",
    "- **Low Degrees (1 and 2)**: The number of features remains relatively small, making the dataset manageable.\n",
    "- **Higher Degrees (3 and above)**: The number of features increases dramatically, illustrating the **curse of dimensionality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Degree 1**: Represents the original dataset with no polynomial expansion.\n",
    "- **Degrees 2 and 3**: Show a moderate increase in the number of features, capturing more complex relationships.\n",
    "- **Degree 4 and Beyond**: Exhibit an exponential rise in the number of features, which can lead to computational inefficiency and overfitting.\n",

    "##### Summary:\n",
    "This plot highlights the trade-off between model complexity and computational cost when using polynomial features. While higher-degree polynomials can model intricate patterns, they also risk overfitting and increased computational demands. Therefore, selecting an appropriate polynomial degree is crucial for balancing model performance and efficiency."

    "### KNN Performance with Polynomial Features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plot Explanation\n",
    "The box plot illustrates the **accuracy** of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier when using different polynomial feature transformations. The x-axis represents the **polynomial degree**, while the y-axis shows the **accuracy** of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Observations:\n",
    "- The **median accuracy** (represented by the orange line) remains relatively stable across polynomial degrees 1 to 4.\n",
    "- The **mean accuracy** (indicated by the green triangle) is consistent across different degrees, suggesting that increasing polynomial features does not significantly enhance performance.\n",
    "- The **variance (spread of the box)** increases slightly for higher polynomial degrees, indicating that additional features may introduce more variability in model performance.\n",
    "- The presence of **outliers** at lower degrees highlights occasional drops in accuracy for specific runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Polynomial Degree 1**: The model performs well, with a high median accuracy and minimal variance.\n",
    "- **Polynomial Degrees 2-4**: While accuracy remains stable, the slight increase in variance suggests that additional polynomial features do not substantially improve KNN performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- Applying polynomial feature expansion does not necessarily improve KNN model accuracy.\n",
    "- Higher polynomial degrees increase feature complexity but may not provide better predictive power, potentially leading to overfitting or computational inefficiency."

    "\n",
    "Through this module, we learned how to create polynomial features to potentially improve model performance. We explored the impact of different polynomial degrees on feature space dimensionality and model accuracy. The techniques demonstrated show how feature engineering can expose non-linear relationships in data that may improve predictive modeling results.\n",
