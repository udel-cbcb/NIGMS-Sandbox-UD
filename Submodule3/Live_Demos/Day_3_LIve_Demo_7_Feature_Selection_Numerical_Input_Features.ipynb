    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of input features that are\n",
    "most relevant to the target variable. Feature selection is often straightforward when working\n",
    "with real-valued input and output data, such as using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, but\n",
    "can be challenging when working with numerical input data and a categorical target variable.\n",
    "The two most commonly used feature selection methods for numerical input data when the\n",
    "target variable is categorical (e.g. classification predictive modeling) are the ANOVA F-test\n",
    "statistic and the mutual information statistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover how to perform\n",
