This is a very important property in drug development: if a proposed drug isn't soluble enough, you probably won't be able to get enough into the patient's bloodstream to have a therapeutic effect.  \n",

One of the core components of DeepChem is MoleculeNet, a diverse collection of chemical and molecular data sets.  For this tutorial, we can use the Delaney solubility data set.

We initializes a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) model using DeepChem's GraphConvModel for predicting molecular solubility—a continuous property (regression task). The GraphConvModel leverages graph convolutions to learn directly from molecular structures (represented as graphs), where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges. This architecture captures atomic interactions and spatial relationships, making it particularly effective for molecular property prediction. The model is now ready for training on the featurized Delaney dataset."
