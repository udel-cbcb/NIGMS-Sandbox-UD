    "There are multiple ways to start a JupyterLab instance on AWS.\n",

    "#### Using Notebook Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set up notebook instances without starting up SageMaker Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the Amazon SageMaker landing page.  \n",
    "1. There are several ways to create/open SageMaker notebook.\n",
    "1. Expand the options at the top left.\n",
    "1. Under `Applications and IDEs` click on `Notebooks`.\n",
    "1. Click the `Create notebook instance` button.\n",
    "1. You should now see a form with options for `Notebook instance settings`.  Fill in the form with the following values:\n",
    "    * `Notebook instance name` -> `test-notebook-1`\n",
    "    * ` Notebook instance type` -> `ml.t3.medium`\n",
    "    * `Platform identifier` -> `Amazon Linux 2, Jupyter Lab 4`\n",
    "    * Leave all other options alone for now.\n",
    "1. Click `Create notebook instance` at the bottom of the form.\n",
    "1. If all went well, you should see a notification banner at the top saying that your notebook instance was created successfully.\n",
    "1. In the `Notebook instances` card, click on the name of your notebook. (In this case, it would be `test-notebook-1`.)\n",
    "    * You should now see a page with information about your notebook instance.\n",
    "    * In particular, you may see a `Status Pending` message.  This will remain until the notebook environment is provisioned.\n",
    "1. Once the status indicator switches to `InService`, you can now start the notebook by clicking the `Open JupyterLab` button.\n",
    "1. After a few moments, you will see the standard JupyterLab launch page.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. You should see a `Launcher` screen.  If not, click on the blue plus button in the top right corner.\n",
    "1. Click on the `conda_python3` card to open a new Python notebook.\n",
    "1. You should now see a new notebook page called `Untitled.ipynb`.\n",
    "1. To test that everything is working as expected, in the currently selected input box, type in the following `print('Hello, World!')`.\n",
    "1. To run the code, either:\n",
    "    * Click on the small play button near the top of the notebook page.\n",
    "    * Type `ctrl-enter` on Windows or Linux, or `command-return` if you are using a Mac.\n",
    "1. You should see `Hello, World!` printed just below the input box.\n",
