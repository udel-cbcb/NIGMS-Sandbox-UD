    "\n",
    "You can set up notebook instances without spinning up SageMaker Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the Amazon SageMaker landing page.  \n",
    "1. There are several ways to create/open Google Colab notebook.\n",
    "1. Expand the options at the top left.\n",
    "1. Under `Applications and IDEs` click on `Notebooks`.\n",
    "1. Click the `Create notebook instance` button.\n",
    "1. You should now see a form with options for `Notebook instance settings`.  Fill in the form with the following values:\n",
    "    * `Notebook instance name` -> `test-notebook-1`\n",
    "    * ` Notebook instance type` -> `ml.t3.medium`\n",
    "    * `Platform identifier` -> `Amazon Linux 2, Jupyter Lab 4`\n",
    "    * Leave all other options alone for now.\n",
    "1. Click `Create notebook instance` at the bottom of the form.\n",
    "1. If all went well, you should see a notification banner at the top saying that your notebook instance was created successfully.\n",
    "1. In the `Notebook instances` card, click on the name of your notebook. (In this case, it would be `test-notebook-1`.)\n",
    "    * You should now see a page with information about your notebook instance.\n",
    "    * In particular, you may see a `Status Pending` message.  This will remain until the notebook environment is provisioned.\n",
    "1. Once the status indicator switches to `InService`, you can now start the notebook by clicking the `Open JupyterLab` button.\n",
    "1. After a few moments, you will see the standard JupyterLab launch page.\n"

    "1. You should see a `Launcher` screen.  If not, click on the blue plus button in the top right corner.\n",
    "1. Click on the `conda_python3` card to open a new Python notebook.\n",
    "1. You should now see a new notebook page called `Untitled.ipynb`.\n",
    "1. To test that everything is working as expected, in the currently selected input box, type in the following `print('Hello, World!')`.\n",
    "1. To run the code, either:\n",
    "    * Click on the small play button near the top of the notebook page.\n",
    "    * Type `ctrl-enter` on Windows or Linux, or `command-return` if you are using a Mac.\n",
