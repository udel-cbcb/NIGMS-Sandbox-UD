If you're new to biology, we recommend checking out the [Best Resources To Learn Molecular Biology For A Computer Scientist](https://www.biostars.org/p/3066/) before proceeding. Those with a strong background in biology can skip directly to the implementation sections.\n",

    "## DNA, RNA, Protein\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNA \n",
    "\n",
    "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the fundamental building block of life. It contains the information cells need to synthesize proteins and replicate themselves. In short, DNA serves as the storage repository for the information required for any cell to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA is composed of four nucleotide bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C). A DNA sequence typically looks like this: \"ATTGCTGAAGGTGCGG.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of DNA is measured by the number of base pairs it contains, usually expressed in kilobase pairs (kBp) or megabase pairs (mBp). Each base has a complementary base, meaning in the double-helical structure of DNA, Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA is organized into tightly wound structures called chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of **chromosomes**, which are further divided into smaller segments known as **genes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the arrangement of the four nucleotide bases in DNA is called **DNA sequencing**. There are various methods for sequencing DNA, often performed using specialized machines or through a process called gel electrophoresis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RNA\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA is somewhat similar to DNA; both are nucleic acids composed of nitrogen-containing bases linked by a sugar-phosphate backbone. However, structural and functional differences distinguish RNA from DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structurally, RNA is single-stranded, whereas DNA is double-stranded. DNA contains the base Thymine (T), while RNA contains Uracil (U) instead. Additionally, RNA nucleotides include the sugar ribose, unlike DNA, which contains deoxyribose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionally, DNA serves as the repository for protein-encoding information, while RNA uses this information to facilitate the synthesis of specific proteins within the cell."

    "### Proteins\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are essential to all life forms. In fact, it is often said that without proteins, life as we know it would not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are sequences composed of 20 different amino acids, linked together by polypeptide bonds. The structure of a protein directly influences its chemical activity within an organism. Most proteins adopt a three-dimensional (3D) structure, which enables them to perform a wide variety of functions in living organisms. The complexity of protein structure makes it a challenging yet fascinating subject for research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, proteins are represented as sequences of 20 distinct letters, with each letter corresponding to a specific amino acid. Amino acids linked together in a protein chain are often referred to as residues. The term \"residue\" is commonly used when referring to a specific amino acid at a particular position within a protein chain."

    "### Transcription\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of reading DNA and creating RNA from it is called *transcription*. On the computational side, we will use the same DNA sequence and replace the DNA nucleotide \"T\" with \"U\". The Python code `dna.replace(\"T\", \"U\")` accomplishes this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DNA strand that has the same sequence as the RNA is called the **coding strand**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Most RNA molecules go on to specify protein amino acid sequences in a process called **translation**; these are known as messenger RNAs (mRNA).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each subsequent group of *three* bases is called a **codon**.\n",
    "- The regions of an RNA chain that are removed are called **introns**, while those that remain are called **exons**.\n",
    "- The presence of introns makes it significantly more challenging to determine which parts of a gene are actually used to produce protein sequences.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Important tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit the sequences into appropriate data structures, ensuring they are reusable.\n",
    "- The simplest and most common approach is to store sequences as text:\n",
    "    - DNA and RNA can be represented as strings composed of 4 distinct characters:\n",
    "        - DNA: A, C, G, T\n",
    "        - RNA: A, C, G, U\n",
    "    - Proteins can be represented as strings composed of 20 distinct characters, each corresponding to a specific amino acid.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1. Translating a DNA sequence into protein\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will translate a given DNA sequence into a protein using pre-defined structures for amino acid (aa) representation. For now, we will focus solely on implementing the core concept of translation, without considering starting codons, stop codons, or special codons."
