nonflavonoids are another type of phenol.\n","\n","1. **Proanthocyanins**: proanthocyanidins are yet another type of phenol.\n","\n","1. **Color intensity**: the color intensity of a wine: i.e., how dark it is.\n","\n","1. **Hue**: the hue of a wine, which is typically determined by the color of the cultivar used (although this is not always the case).\n","\n","1. **OD280/OD315 of diluted
