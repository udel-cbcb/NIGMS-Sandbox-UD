It contains the information the cell requires to synthesize protein and to replicate itself, to be short it is the storage repository for the information that is required for any cell to function.\n","\n","There are basically four nucleotide bases, which make up the DNA. Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Thymine (T) and Cytosine(C). A DNA sequence looks some thing like this \"ATTGCTGAAGGTGCGG\". \n","\n","DNA is measured according to the number of base pairs it consists of, usually in kBp or mBp (Kilo/Mega base pairs). Each base has its complementary base, which means in the double helical structure of DNA, A will have T as its complimentary and similarly G will have C.\n","\n","The DNA is broken down into bits and is tightly wound into coils, which are called **chromosomes**; human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes. These chromosomes are further broken down into smaller pieces of code called **Genes**. \n","\n","DNA is made up of four nucleotide bases, finding out the arrangement of the bases is called **DNA sequencing**, there are various methods for sequencing a DNA, it is usually carried out by a machine or by running the DNA sample over a gel otherwise called gel electrophoresis.\n","\n","###RNA\n","\n","RNA is somewhat similar to DNA; they both are nucleic acids of nitrogen-containing bases joined by sugar-phosphate backbone. However structural and functional differences distinguish RNA from DNA. \n","\n","Structurally, RNA is a single-stranded where as DNA is double stranded. DNA has Thymine (T), where as RNA has Uracil (U). RNA nucleotides include sugar ribose, rather than the Deoxyribose that is part of DNA. \n","\n","Functionally, DNA maintains the protein-encoding information, whereas RNA uses the information to enable the cell to synthesize the particular protein.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oBw_Eb459Z6h"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uKiWa3lg1GYs"},"source":["\n","### Proteins:\n","Proteins are the most commonly used in life forms, we may say that without proteins we would not exist.\n","\n","They are sequences made up with 20 different amino acids by _polypeptides_. Structure of the protein effects the chemical activity of the body/life directly. Most proteins are in 3D structure which gives them an ability to vary their functionality in the life forms. Protein structure and it's structure is exceedingly complex and not easy to predict which makes it very good subject to focus on research.\n","\n","In computer science we represent proteins as 20 different letters putting to gether as a sequence, where each letter represents different amino acids. The amino acids that are linked into a protein chain are often referred to as residues. You will see the term residue used when one wants to refer to a particular amino acid in a particular position of a protein chain.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fKThntmG1GYt"},"source":["\n","### Transcription\n","The process of reading DNA and creating RNA from it is called _transcription_.

Translating a DNA sequence into protein:\n","In this example, we will translate the given DNA sequence into the protein according to pre-defined structures for aa-protein representation.
