    "## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "THis lecture will introduce you to the field of Artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start a new topic with some historical background as it helps to understand the evolution of the field and how knowledge builds in many cases aligned with the technological advancements. We will provide a comprehensive overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), introducing both the concepts and their practical applications. AI, defined by pioneer John McCarthy as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines,” aims to create systems that can replicate human understanding, thinking, learning, and behavior. The applications of AI span numerous fields, including agriculture, where it’s used for robotics, crop monitoring, and predictive analysis, and healthcare, where it assists in diagnostics. In the biomedical sphere, AI supports complex tasks like protein structure prediction, data categorization, and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between AI and ML is key to understanding the field. While AI broadly represents the ambition to emulate human-like abilities, ML is a specific subset of AI that focuses on training machines to learn from data. This learning process is structured around three main components: the task (T), which defines the problem to solve (e.g., classification or regression), experience (E), where an algorithm learns patterns from data, and performance (P), a metric (such as accuracy or F1 score) used to assess how well the model performs the task over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods are categorized primarily by the amount of human supervision involved: supervised learning relies on labeled data to predict outputs, unsupervised learning finds patterns without labels, and reinforcement learning teaches an agent to optimize actions based on feedback (rewards or penalties). Models generated by ML algorithms represent the learned relationships between inputs and outputs. These models can be applied either in batch (offline) mode, where a fixed dataset trains the model before deployment, or online mode, where continuous learning from new data keeps the model updated. Model-based learning and instance-based learning further divide methods based on whether predictions come directly from a model or are based on stored examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and evaluating ML models is crucial, involving phases like training (optimizing model parameters), validation (monitoring for overfitting), and testing (assessing model performance on new data). Cross-validation, where the data is split into several subsets, helps refine model performance across different conditions. Understanding the types of data is also fundamental, as different data structures (categorical, continuous) influence the choice of algorithms and model approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this lecture gives a structured framework to approach AI and ML, emphasizing how models are created, trained, and evaluated across diverse applications."
